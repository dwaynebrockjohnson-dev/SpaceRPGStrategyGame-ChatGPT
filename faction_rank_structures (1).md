# Faction Structures — Nobility, Command Protocols, Military Doctrines & Realpolitik Dynamics

## Solar Empire — Nobility First, Power Divided

- **Noble Ranks:** Prince, Lord, Baron, Sir.
- **Naval Ranks:** Grand Admiral → Admiral → Vice Admiral → Rear Admiral → Commodore → Captain → Commander → Lieutenant → Ensign.
- **Army Ranks:** Marshal → General → Colonel → Major → Captain → Lieutenant → Sergeant → Trooper.
- **Protocol:** Nobility *always* takes precedence in address.
  - Example: “Lord Havelock” (even if he is a Major).
  - Nobility outranks military titles in address; in operational contexts, command rank applies.
- **Doctrine:** Admirals push for decisive fleet engagements to project dominance; generals argue for long-term control through occupation forces. Neither side can dominate without the other, creating mutual dependency.
- **Culture:** Aristocratic, ceremonial, but rife with corruption and patronage. Favor-trading among nobles often determines who receives commissions. Duels and intrigue in court politics bleed into military life.
- **Diplomacy:** Publicly cloaked in rhetoric of patronage and imperial destiny, privately deals are struck with rivals, mercenaries, or even enemies to shore up noble prestige.
- **Internal Tension:** Rivalry between Army and Navy is sharpened by competition for budgetary allocations. Admirals argue for shipyards and fleet expansion, generals for recruitment and occupation logistics. The Emperor or Senate often plays them off against each other.
- **Titles of Address:**
  - Naval officer: “Lord-Admiral,” “Grand Admiral,” or simply “My Lord.”
  - Army officer: “Lord-General,” “Marshal,” or “My Lord.”
  - Court and field both demand deference to noble rank first.
- **Realpolitik Angle:** The nobility weaponize their commissions for political leverage, sometimes holding back reinforcements to embarrass rivals. Foreign diplomacy often doubles as a proxy war between different aristocratic cliques.

## Paraxis League — Unity on Paper, Fracture in Practice

- **One Service:** Navy and Marines are not separate. All personnel are **Fleet officers**; marines are Fleet units reassigned for ground or boarding duties.
- **Officer Ranks:** Admiral → Commodore → Captain → Commander → Lieutenant → Ensign.
- **Enlisted Ranks:** Master Chief → Chief Petty Officer → Petty Officer → Leading Spacer → Spacer.
- **Protocol:** Same rank = same authority, regardless of assignment.
- **Doctrine:** Rapid deployments, carrier groups, marine boarding. Efficiency and pragmatism drive strategy.
- **Culture:** Meritocratic, but heavily political. Officers debate in mess halls, and Senate blocs try to influence promotions.
- **Planetary Armies:** Each planet fields its own armed forces outside Senate control. These armies have varied doctrines (armored divisions, light infantry, planetary defense fortresses) and serve planetary governments first. They often clash with Fleet command over authority in joint operations.
- **Diplomacy:** Bargaining culture; contracts and pacts are binding. League politicians, however, often use treaties as temporary leverage, leading to accusations of betrayal.
- **Tone:** Pragmatic, professional, but rife with distrust between Fleet loyalists and planetary militias.
- **Titles of Address:** Strictly by rank (e.g., “Admiral,” “Captain”). Planetary armies use diverse traditions, sometimes ignoring Fleet formalities.
- **Realpolitik Angle:** The Senate deliberately tolerates fragmentation to keep planets dependent on central mediation. Admirals may sabotage planetary militias by denying supplies, while planetary lords sometimes hold back troops unless Senate concessions are made.

## Sarax Empire — Ruthless and Expansionist

- **Government:** Monarchy with military council.
- **Military Ranks:** Field Marshal → General → Brigadier → Colonel → Major → Captain → Lieutenant → Ensign.
- **Doctrine:** Expansion via overwhelming ground invasions. Orbital artillery supports infantry waves.
- **Culture:** Sacrifice and discipline above all. Public displays of scars and medals demonstrate legitimacy.
- **Diplomacy:** Negotiation is viewed as weakness. Demands for tribute or submission precede talks.
- **Tone:** Austere, nationalist, martial.
- **Realpolitik Angle:** Generals compete for glory and the Emperor’s favor. Failed campaigns are scapegoated on rivals, not circumstances.

## Sarapin Federation — Federal Pragmatists

- **Government:** Senate-controlled federal republic.
- **Military Ranks:** Admiral → Vice Admiral → Rear Admiral → Captain → Commander → Lieutenant → Ensign.
- **Doctrine:** Defensive navy and secure logistics. Slow-moving but resilient.
- **Culture:** Bureaucratic; officers are as much administrators as soldiers.
- **Diplomacy:** Excels at treaties and coalitions, though often stalls in political deadlock.
- **Tone:** Stable, bureaucratic, defensive.
- **Realpolitik Angle:** Federal gridlock means local governors often cut deals independently. Coalition politics inside the Senate can paralyze military response until rivals exploit it.

## Independent Frontier Worlds — Decentralized Opportunists

- **Government:** Local militias, merchant guilds, or warlords.
- **Military Ranks:** Captain → Lieutenant → Sergeant → Militiaman.
- **Doctrine:** Guerilla warfare, piracy, opportunistic raiding.
- **Culture:** Fragmented, eccentric, shaped by trade or survival.
- **Diplomacy:** Alliances are temporary and pragmatic.
- **Tone:** Opportunistic, unreliable, volatile.
- **Realpolitik Angle:** Smugglers, mercenaries, and militias often shift allegiances for pay. Larger powers exploit them as pawns but risk instability when promises go unpaid.

## Why This Works

- **Continuity:** Institutions are stable, but political competition corrodes them.
- **Drama Hooks:**
  - Solar Empire → nobility vs merit, army vs navy rivalry, patronage networks.
  - Paraxis League → Senate vs planetary armies, opportunism, sabotage.
  - Sarax Empire → authoritarian infighting, scapegoating.
  - Sarapin Federation → bureaucracy undermining rapid response.
  - Frontier → wild card allegiances.
- **Realpolitik Flavor:** Power is transactional. Alliances are tools. Leaders maneuver for influence as much as victory. Continuity is driven not only by tradition but by constant scheming, betrayal, and calculated compromise.
